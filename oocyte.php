                    </h2>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30"> Oocyte or egg freezing is the process where eggs from female are extracted, frozen and stored with liquid nitrogen for later reproductive potential for in women of reproductive age. It is an established science now and no more an experimental procedure. Thousands of healthy babies are born in last decade with frozen eggs. Overall it is an established fact that it doesn’t increase rate of complications.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">When one can freeze eggs?<br>
                        All the young women who wants to continue climbing their career ladder and plan pregnancy once they are established in their career, are planning oocyte freezing. Typical examples are many Bollywood celebrities, who freeze their eggs when they are young and later on they plan pregnancy. Many corporates offer help to their female employees for egg freezing. Even this is option for females with some malignancy undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
                        <br><br>So who needs egg freezing?
                    </p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">1. Women undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy for cancer care<br>
                        2. Fertility preservation for later pregnancy<br>
                        3. Surgeries that may cause damage to ovaries<br>
                        4. Females at risk for premature ovarian failure<br>
                        5. Severe Ovarian disease</p>

                    <p class="h5 mb-30">One can freeze eggs even for 10 years without any side effects. Thousands are babies born with frozen eggs. There is no established study which shows increased incidence of congenital defect in babies with frozen eggs.</p>

                    <p class="h5 mb-30">How do you freeze and store eggs?<br>Oocyte retrieval and oocyte freezing is safe and established procedure in field of IVF now.</p>
                    <P class="h5 mb-30">It involves following steps,
                    </P>

                    <p class="h5 mb-30">Step-1: Assessment of ovarian reserve and feasibility. This includes history taking, physical examination, ultrasound and various blood tests.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">Step-2: Ovarian stimulation with the help of hormonal injection.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">Step-3: Oocyte retrieval under anesthesia or deep sedation per vaginally.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">Step-4: Assessment of maturity under high definition microscope.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">Step-5. Cryopreservation of mature eggs is done mostly by vitrification method and with the the help of rapid cooling using liquid nitrogen.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">What are the chances of pregnancy with frozen eggs?<br>

                        Successful pregnancy rate is in the range of 5-15% per frozen and thawed oocyte. We need morestudies to come to conclusion.</p>

                <h4 class="heading font-bold">Process of female egg donation </h4>
                <hr>
                <p>The following steps are involved in the female egg donation,</p>
                <P>Step 1: Screening of egg donors is crucial step in egg donation process. It is done in stepwise manner starting with detailed history, followed by examination, ultrasonography of abdomen and then various blood tests, genetic tests and ends psychological analysis of egg donors. Doctors make sure that all egg donors are healthy in all aspects before they donate eggs. Once the donor is finalized, her cycle is matched with patient’s cycle.</P>
                <P>Step 2: Synchronization with the Resident Cycle. In this phase, the egg donor is given contraceptive drugs on the third day of her menstrual cycle(menstrual cycle) to keep her hormones and ovaries functioning.</P>
                <P>Step-3: Supersession of the Cycle is done to prevent ovulation on its own in donors. If they ovulate on their own, doctors won’t get eggs for IVF.</P>
                <P>Step-4: Stimulation of donors ovaries to produce more follicles(eggs) is done various injections. Even these injections improve quality of follicles and increase its quantity.</P>
                <P>Step-5: Retrieval of Eggs after giving sedation or general anaesthesia is done in IVF Operation Theater after taking maximum sterile precautions. It’s done with the help of wide bore needle and specialized suction pump. Needle is inserted per vaginally and thus retrieved eggs are immediately transferred in culture media and for analysis in IVF laboratory. All good, matured eggs are fertilized by IVF procedure or by ICSI procedure.</P>
                <P>Step-6:Follow-up of donor is important to prevent any untoward effect. Donors are kept in hospital for few hours for observation and then discharged after few specific instruction. </P>
                <p>What are Ethical Issues?<br>
                    Third party reproduction via IVF with donor eggs, has various ethical issues including conflict of interest between agents, donor and recipient. Detailed informed consent and counselling of donor is crucial to prevent problems. It is said that only a woman can understand the sorrow of a woman in the best way. Therefore, if you are a healthy woman, you should donate or encourage other womens to donate eggs if someone needs it. Your one Egg Donation can change life of a family to great extent.</p>
