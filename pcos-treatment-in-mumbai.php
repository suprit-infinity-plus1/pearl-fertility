                    </h2>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">Polycystic Ovarian disease (PCOD) or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal imbalance affecting 5-10% of women between 15-45 years of age. PCOD usually leads to irregular menstrual period, abnormal weight gain, no ovulation, hirsuitism, acne and ultimately leading to infertility.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30"> Most of the symptoms are due to increase in male hormone levels in women leading to all above symptoms. Effect of PCOD are interrelated on your body, hormonal changes leads to various changes in body including mood swings, anxiety and depression.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">In modern times, females have to do look after responsibilities at home as well as office. This puts them at added stress and increased symptoms of PCOD. Eventually because of immense stress, work pressure, increased expectation at home leads to health deterioration leading to more psychological trauma.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">Sometimes physical inactivity adds to various problems of PCOD / PCOS. This disease is endemic in many parts of world affecting many women’s and girls in modern world today.</p>

                    <p class="h5 mb-30">Let me tell you that many school going girls even with moderate obesity, have this Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD). If PCOD is detected early at a young age, then it can be treated very effectively with very few basic measures like diet, lifestyle modification and sometimes few pills.</p>

                    <p class="h5 mb-30">So PCOD / PCOS is ‘polycystic ovary disease; polycystic ovary syndrome and in it, the malehormone, “androgen” levels are increased in a woman’s body due to the vesicles or cysts formation in the ovaries.</p>

                    <p class="h5 mb-30">It is not known exactly what causes PCOD but inflammation, genetic factors or insulin resistance</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">is probable reason for increased androgen levels. This high androgen levels prevent follicle formation or follicle maturation. Lot of research is being done in this matter. Many doctors believe that incidence of PCOD is very high with stress, anxiety, early onset menarche and obesity in women.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">Now a days, incidence is so high that one in ten women of childbearing age suffer from PCOD.</p>
                    <p class="h5 mb-30">Few years back, this problem was prevalent in women aged 30-35, but now a days it is more seen in school going adolescent girls.</p>
